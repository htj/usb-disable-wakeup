This is a script and service to prevent a logitech usb receiver from waking up
a suspended linux system immediately. 

There are other good sources for solutions:

I just wanted something dead simple, that I could understand in 1 minute.

Installation:

Modify the vendor / product ids in usb-disable-wakeup to your liking.

$ cp usb-disable-wakeup /usr/local/bin/
$ cp usb-disable-wakeup.service /etc/systemd/system/
$ systemctl daemon-reload
$ systemctl enable usb-disable-wakeup.service

(You probably need to use sudo).

Test with

$ systemctl suspend
